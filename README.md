## 🚀 Overview

**Job Search Match (Manager Mode)** is a **decision-oriented job discovery and filtering application** built specifically for **senior analytics professionals**.

This is **not** a mass job scraper or ATS keyword matcher.

The app is designed around how **real senior hiring decisions are made**:

- Role seniority matters more than tools  
- Decision ownership matters more than dashboards  
- Compensation matters more than buzzwords  

The outcome is deliberate:

**Fewer roles. Higher relevance. Zero noise.**

---

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

### 🎯 Manager-Only Role Filtering
Surfaces roles aligned with senior accountability, including:
- Senior Analytics Manager  
- Analytics / Performance Analytics Manager  
- Decision Analytics, Planning, and Risk Analytics roles  

Actively **rejects IC-heavy roles** such as Data Scientist, ML Engineer, or tool-centric positions.

---

### 💰 Smart Salary Intelligence (INR)
Built for senior compensation realities:
- Minimum fixed CTC threshold (24+ LPA)  
- Salary-weighted ranking (pay > keywords)  
- Safe fallback handling for missing or vague salary data  

---

### 📊 Decision-Weighted Job Scoring
Each role is ranked using a **recruiter-aligned scoring model** based on:
- Compensation relevance  
- Decision analytics scope  
- Forecasting, planning, and KPI ownership  

Explicitly **not optimized** for ML/NLP buzzwords or ATS keyword density.

---

### 🧭 Recruiter-First Signal Layer
To avoid outdated or low-signal postings, the app adds:
- **Noise Score** to flag mass-hiring or irrelevant roles  
- **Worth Messaging Recruiter** indicator  
- **Why this role fits you** (one-line rationale)  

This ensures effort is spent only where conversion probability is real.

---

### ✉️ Application-Ready Outputs
The app supports immediate execution by generating:
- Two-line recruiter outreach messages  
- Manager-level resume signal alignment  
- Weekly CSV export for follow-ups and tracking
