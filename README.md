## 🚀 Overview

**Job Search Match (Manager Mode)** is a **decision-oriented job discovery and filtering application** built specifically to surface **senior-level analytics roles**.

Unlike generic job boards or resume matchers, this app is designed around how **real senior hiring works**:

- Role seniority matters more than tools  
- Decision ownership matters more than dashboards  
- Compensation matters more than buzzwords  

The outcome is intentional:  
**fewer roles, higher relevance, zero noise**.

## 🧠 Key Capabilities

### 🎯 Manager-Only Role Filtering  
Surfaces only roles aligned to senior accountability, such as:
- Senior Analytics Manager  
- Analytics / Performance Analytics Manager  
- Decision Analytics, Planning, or Risk Analytics roles  

Hard-rejects IC-heavy or tool-centric roles (Data Scientist, ML Engineer, etc.).

---

### 💰 Smart Salary Intelligence (INR)  
Designed for senior compensation realities:
- Minimum fixed CTC threshold (LPA)  
- Salary-weighted ranking (pay > keywords)  
- Fallback logic for missing or vague salary data  

---

### 📊 Decision-Weighted Job Scoring  
Jobs are ranked based on:
- Salary relevance  
- Decision analytics scope  
- Forecasting, planning, KPI ownership  

Explicitly **not** optimized for ML/NLP buzzwords or ATS keyword density.

---

### 🧾 Application-Ready Outputs  
The app supports senior execution by providing:
- Manager-level resume bullet signals  
- Senior-safe screening answers  
- Clean job logging for tracking and follow-up
